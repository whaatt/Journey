Journey To The Motherland
=========================
Your Country Never Sounded So Good

### Compilation Instructions
1. Install OpenFrameworks using their platform-specific guides.
2. Create a new project using the project generator for your platform.
3. Copy the contents of the `src` folder to your project source folder.
4. The tricky part: download and link the FFTW library with your project.
5. Check that the FFTW variant is based on single-precision floating point.
6. Make sure that the `src/beat` folder is in the compiler search path.
7. Hit compile and pray to the many gods of cross-platform support.

### TLDR
Screenshots are available [here](http://imgur.com/a/nrEah). Suggestions
or pull requests are very welcome. The portal consists of the waveform
on the wall, the time-varying FFT as bands, and color accents on beats.

### Summary
Most of the features in my program were pretty unintended. This project
was my first serious foray into computer graphics, so I sort of tinkered
with stuff until it looked good. Often times, this approach was somewhat
frustrating, but I think I ended up learning a lot about how to draw the
things you want to draw. As for the theme of the visualizer, I'll let it
speak for itself. That was also sort of an accident.

### Disclosure
My roommates Sam Garcia and Cameron Steinfeld helped me judge the
trippyness of my visualizer as I went through the creative process
and journeyed toward the motherland.
